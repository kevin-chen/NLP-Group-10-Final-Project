now here is a volume that goes into the world and lacks your

stranger still! I have watched with interest, with pain, and at length

The Town Hall in Rossville stands on a moderate elevation overlooking
the principal street. It is generally open only when a meeting has been
called by the Selectmen to transact town business, or occasionally in
the evening when a lecture on temperance or a political address is to be

lectures, and the townspeople are obliged to depend for intellectual
nutriment upon such chance occasions as t
